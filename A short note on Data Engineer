We’re all living in the century of data now. Machine learning and data analysis technologies have already become an integral part of our present-day life.
The world is going to revolve around Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms for sure. The sole purpose of algorithms or models is data, we say in one linear "the garbage you put, the garbage you get". It means every model or algorithm totally depends upon the dataset, and it's a very crucial role of a data engineer to prepare the dataset and make sure everything is being taken care of at the processing side. Once the processing is optimum then the magic can happen but the magic trick is the dataset.
We all know how the world is producing in terms of volume, velocity, variety its unmatchable and the job of a data engineer becomes important day by day, it's not limited to do the processing its a whole different world where we manage the velocity of the dataset along with the variety and on top of doing the processing to find the meaningful data for the data scientist.The role was not popular a decade back, but from the last 10 years, we have seen the tremendous transformation of the world in the tech, and it's going to evolve exponentially in the near future. And to manage with proper architecture along with the stable ETL for the huge volume of data and processing the big data in near real-time using distributed approach are playing an important role and it's going to make more impact in near future as well.
